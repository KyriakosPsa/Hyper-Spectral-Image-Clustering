# Hyper-Spectral-Image-Clustering

This analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various clustering algorithms, including cost function optimization methods (k-means, fuzzy c-means, possibilistic c-means, and probabilistic clustering) and hierarchical algorithms (Complete-link, WPGMC, and Ward), in identifying homogeneous regions within the Salinas Hyperspectral Image (HSI).
