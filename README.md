# Hyper-Spectral-Image-Clustering

This analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various clustering algorithms in in identifying homogeneous regions within the Salinas valley in california Hyperspectral Image (HSI).

- Cost function optimization clustering algorithms:
  - K-means
  - Fuzzy c-means
  - Possibilistic c-means
  - Probabilistic clustering(Gaussian Mixture Models)
- Hierarchical algorithms:
    - Complete-link
    - WPGMC
    - Ward

The Matlab code along with the exported pdf are provided.
